# Combating_Crop_Pests_with_AI Hackathon

## Overview  
This project addresses the significant challenge posed by the fall armyworm, a pest responsible for approximately 31% annual maize losses in Africa. By leveraging artificial intelligence, the goal is to develop innovative solutions that can detect and manage crop pests effectively, thereby enhancing food security across the continent.

## Problem Statement  
The fall armyworm lacks natural predators in Africa, leading to widespread infestations and substantial crop damage. Traditional pest control methods are often inadequate or environmentally harmful. This project aims to harness AI technologies to create efficient, sustainable, and scalable solutions for pest detection and management.

## Dataset   
Participants are provided with a dataset comprising images of crops affected by various pests, including the fall armyworm. The dataset is intended to train and evaluate AI models capable of identifying pest infestations accurately.

## Approach  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and annotating the dataset to ensure quality inputs for model training.

- **Model Selection**: Exploring various AI models suitable for image classification and object detection tasks.

- **Training and Evaluation**: Implementing models using frameworks like PyTorch, followed by rigorous evaluation to assess performance.

- **Optimization**: Fine-tuning models to improve accuracy and reduce false positives/negatives.

## Results  
The implemented AI models demonstrated promising results in accurately detecting pest infestations in crop images. The best-performing model achieved an **`accuracy of 99.69%`**, showcasing the potential of AI in agricultural pest management.

## Future Work  
- **Real-world Deployment**: Integrating the AI models into drone systems for real-time field monitoring.

- **Expanded Dataset**: Collecting more diverse data to improve model robustness across different crop types and pest species.

- **Collaborations**: Partnering with agricultural organizations to pilot the solutions in real farming environments.
